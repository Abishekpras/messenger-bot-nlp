## Before we start

 * A [github](https://github.com/join?source=login) account
 * Create an account and install [Heroku Command Line](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
 * Make sure you have a [Facebook App](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) account that is not currently using webhooks
 * And a [wit.ai](https://wit.ai/) account, it will do the NLP heavy lifting for free!
 
## Set-up

 * Fork this repository. Then when deploying to Heroku the code will stay synced with whatever changes you make on your copy
 * [Create](https://www.facebook.com/pages/create/) a Facebook page that will be the face of your bot
 * [Create](https://wit.ai/apps/new) a wit.ai app that will be its brain
 * Take note of your wit.ai *Server Access Token*. You can get it from the settings page
 * First is we will configure your Facebook App
